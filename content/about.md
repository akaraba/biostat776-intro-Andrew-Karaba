Fun facts about me.
1. I have a grandmother who is 103 years old.
2. I once sat on the bench that John Quincy Adams died on.
3. I slept over at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago when I was a kid.
4. I have 2 sons under 4.
5. I've been inside the oldest intact building on earth.

This is a great podcast on Virology...and I was once on it (maybe that is a 6th fact).
