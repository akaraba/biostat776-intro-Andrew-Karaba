Hello!
My name is Andrew Karaba. I am a new assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases. I am originally from the Chicago area. I trained at Northwestern University where I got my MD and PhD and came to Hopkins for my internal medicine residency in 2015. I then completed a fellowship in infectious disease and joined the faculty this year. My research interests include virology, innate immunity, and vaccine responses in immunocompromised hosts. I have some limited statistics knowledge (took the summer institute biostats course last year) and am self taught in R. I would like to learn to be more efficient in my R programming, how to use github, and how to utilize multidimensional analysis in my research.
